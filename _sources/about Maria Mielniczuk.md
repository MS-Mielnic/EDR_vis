 <img src="IMG_5360.png" alt="my photo" width="200px"/>

Right now, I am in the middle of a Master in Applied Data Science at the School of Information of the University of Michigan. Also, I work at Splunk, a data platform focused in observability and security. 
I live near Dallas, Texas, with my husband, children and dog.
However, this is not all about me or the career I developed in the last 15 years working in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and United States. Please, visit my linkedin at linkedin.com/in/silviamielniczuk

And check out the content pages bundled with this book to see some of the skills I have developed in Data Science or access my github at https://github.com/MS-Mielnic.
