At the moment, I am in the middle of a Master in Applied Data Science at the School of Information of the University of Michigan. 
Also, I work at Splunk, a data platform focused in observability and security.<br />
I live near Dallas, Texas, with my husband, children and dog.<br />
However, this is not all about me or the career I developed in the last 15 years working in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and United States.<br />
Please, visit my linkedin at linkedin.com/in/silviamielniczuk<br />

And check out the content pages bundled with this book to see some of the skills I have developed in Data Science or access my github at https://github.com/MS-Mielnic.
