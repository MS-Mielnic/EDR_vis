If I were a geometrical figure I would be a tetrahedral, four places that converge in different vertices. I say this because in the last 15 years I developed my career in different areas such as journalism, technology, marketing, business development, technical sales, and also in different countries: Argentina, Brasil, Mexico, and now United States.
Always something to learn, and always translating previous knowledge and experiences. I am very proud of my creativity and hability to adapt and solve situations, and enjoy very much all challenges.
Right now, I am in the middle of a Master in Applied Data Science at the School of Information of the University of Michigan. Also, I work at Splunk, a data platform focused in observability and security.
I live near Dallas, Texas, with my husband, children and dog.
